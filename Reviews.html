      <h> <b> <br> Current websites <br/></b></h>
<p>The Morden websites are accessible to those people who have disabilities such as colour blindness, poor eyesight, blindness, and deaf. There are features included on the websites which allows the information to be readability by changing the colour of the text on a white background. For those who have poor eyesight they can use screen magnifiers to see the text more clearly and makes the text readability for the users. All these issues can be solved for disabilities people by not making the font size below 12 because it’s not suitable for poor eyesight people and also having small text size on the website makes the user unreadability. Those people are blind there is screen reader software added on the modern websites which helps to read aloud everything that appears on the user screen. The screen reader software reads the entire web pages and read it aloud, line by line, in the exact order that appears on the user websites. However, it can’t read images, but for example, in a photo of two girls playing dancing then the screen reader tells the blind person that “picture of two girls dancing”.</p>
 <h> <b><br> Background videos</b> </br></h>
 <P> A Modern website have a video which plays automatically in the background. They are mainly used to deliver an information to the audience and helps to decrease the amount of content which is required in order to deliver information. The videos help to understand the main points about the websites without having to read a single line of text. For example,<a href ="https://wistia.com/">https://wistia.com/. </a> </P>
<h> <b><br> Large and Responsive hero images</b></h>
<P> A modern have a large image which are often placed in the background with text and other content overlaid on top for example <a href=" https://dog-jogs.ca/"> https://dog-jogs.ca/</a> A large image helps to visually deliver the information without having to rely on text. They often encourage you to scroll down to read more and attractive user attention easily. </P>
<h> <br><b>Hamburger Menus</b> <br/></h>
<p>  Most of websites now you visit have hamburger menus because it helps to have a clear path for user to take. By removing navigation makes the user experience cleaner and distraction free. This helps to improve user experience and user can find the information more easily. An example of Hamburger Menus websites is <a href="https://station.ch/en" > https://station.ch/en.</a></p>
